## Random game generator for the board game "Scythe" ðŸŽ²

Live Website https://randomizer-three.vercel.app

Scythe is a large scale strategy board game. Yes, you read that correctly. An actual board game you can play at a table with friends and family. They still exist ðŸ˜‰

One of the best things about the game are it's different starting scenarios. Selecting Nations and Economy Boards for each player gives everyone their own abilities and challenges. A number of expansions allow even more customization with the addition of new nations, airships or various rule changes.

### How it works
The randomizer allows users to select the number of players, what expansions they own and whether or not to exclude the two officially banned combinations of nations and boards. It then generates random starting scenarios, saving players a lot of time drawing straws, tossing coins or rolling dice. The generator also remembers every players last nation and board to ensure that one does not get either of them twice in a row, keeping the games interesting and varied.

### Future Tweaks
- Adding info section on the page
- Customizable player names
- Layout fixes
